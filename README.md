# CaféShop

A Full Stack e-commerce portfolio project. It consists of two **React** sites (a simple **Shop** for clients and an **Admin Dashboard** for managing the inventory and doing CRUD operations) and a **Node Backend**.

### Notes

- User registration is not implemented to make it easier for everyone to test the website.
- Everytime the backend is started, it runs a script to delete everything from the database and repopulate it with clean information.
- The backend is hosted on Heroku's free tier, so the products can take around ten seconds to load the first time if the backend has been inactive for a while.
